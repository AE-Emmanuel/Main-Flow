# Mainflow Python Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository for the projects I worked on during my Python internship at Mainflow. This internship focuses on leveraging Python to solve real-world problems through various coding challenges and projects. The repository contains detailed explanations and instructions for each project.

## Task 1: Python Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples)

In this task, I explored Pythonâ€™s core data structures:

    Lists: Creating, appending, removing, slicing, and sorting data.
    Dictionaries: Adding, updating, and retrieving key-value pairs.
    Tuples: Immutable data handling and tuple operations.


## Task 2: Data Manipulation and Cleaning using Pandas

In this task, I worked with pandas to perform basic data manipulation on a CSV dataset. Key steps involved:

    Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, fixing inconsistencies.
    Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifying and clearing outliers to improve data quality.
    Data Exploration: Using pandas to filter, sort, and summarize the dataset.

This task provided essential experience in pre-processing and cleaning data, preparing me for more complex data science tasks ahead.
