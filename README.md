# Mainflow Python Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository for the projects I worked on during my Python internship at Mainflow. This internship focuses on leveraging Python to solve real-world problems through various coding challenges and projects. The repository contains detailed explanations and instructions for each project.

## Task 1: Python Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples)

In this task, I explored Pythonâ€™s core data structures:

    Lists: Creating, appending, removing, slicing, and sorting data.
    Dictionaries: Adding, updating, and retrieving key-value pairs.
    Tuples: Immutable data handling and tuple operations.


## Task 2: Data Manipulation and Cleaning using Pandas

In this task, I worked with pandas to perform basic data manipulation on a CSV dataset. Key steps involved:

    Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, fixing inconsistencies.
    Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifying and clearing outliers to improve data quality.
    Data Exploration: Using pandas to filter, sort, and summarize the dataset.

This task provided essential experience in pre-processing and cleaning data, preparing me for more complex data science tasks ahead.


## Task 3: Web Scraping using Python (requests and BeautifulSoup)

In this task, I created a web scraper using requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract data from a webpage. The scraper performs the following actions:

    Extracts Text: Retrieves all visible text from the webpage.
    Extracts Links: Collects all hyperlinks from the page.
    Extracts Images: Grabs all image URLs found on the page.

    
## Task 4: Simple Calculator using Pillow & Tkinter

In this task, I created a GUI-based calculator using Python's Pillow and Tkinter libraries. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and showcases the use of images in a graphical user interface.

Key Features:

    Tkinter: Used to create the graphical interface with buttons and display fields.
    Pillow: Integrated custom images for buttons.
    Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Technologies Used:

    Python 3.x
    Pillow for handling images
    Tkinter for GUI design

This task provided great experience in GUI development and how to create interactive applications using Python.

## Task 5: Real-Time Currency Converter

This task focused on creating a USD Currency Converter Application using Python. The application features a Tkinter GUI and integrates with a real-time exchange rate API to provide accurate conversions.

Features:

    Real-Time Conversion: Fetches current exchange rates from a reliable API.
    User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter, featuring input fields, dropdowns for currency selection, and conversion buttons.
    Multiple Currency Support: Converts USD to various international currencies.

Technologies Used:

    Python 3.x
    Tkinter for GUI design
    API Integration for real-time data

This project was a fantastic opportunity to blend GUI development with API utilization, resulting in a practical application for currency conversions.
